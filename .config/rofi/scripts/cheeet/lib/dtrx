| dtrx    | -r, --recursive         | With this option, dtrx will search inside the archives you specify to see if any of the contents are themselves archives, and extract those as well.                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| dtrx    | --one, --one-entry      | Normally, if an archive only contains one file or directory with a name that doesn't match the archive's, dtrx will ask you how to handle it. With this option, you can specify ahead of time what should happen.                                                                     | Possible values are: \n\n\t inside\n\t\t Extract the file/directory inside another directory named after the archive.  This is the default.\n\n\t rename\n\t\t Extract the file/directory in the current directory, and then rename it to match the name of the archive. \n\n\t here \n\t\t Extract the file/directory in the current directory. |
| dtrx    | -o, --overwrite         | Normally, dtrx will avoid extracting into a directory that already exists, and instead try to find an alternative name to use.  If this option is listed, dtrx will use the default directory name no matter what.                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| dtrx    | -f, --flat              | Extract all archive contents into the current directory, instead of their own dedicated directory.  This is handy if you have multiple archive files which all need to be extracted into the same directory structure.  Note that existing files may be overwritten with this option. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| dtrx    | -n, --noninteractive    | dtrx will normally ask the user how to handle certain corner cases, such as how to handle an archive that only contains one file.  This option suppresses those questions; dtrx will instead use sane, conservative defaults.                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| dtrx    | -l, -t, --list, --table | Don't extract the archives; just list their contents on standard output.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| dtrx    | -m, --metadata          | Extract the metadata from .deb and .gem archives, instead of their normal contents.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
