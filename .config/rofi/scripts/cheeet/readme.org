* Intro
  It's so diffcuclt for me to remember various parameters and keybinds.

  I find rofi could help me do that, just write them into files and then use =rofi= to query. So I wrote a litte script and a concise rofi theme.

  Currently I am using org-mode for formatting cheatsheet files, and maybe I would write a script to do that someday.

  Hope this script could help people facing the problem of reciting parameters and keybinds.

  Share your cheasheet.

   - *Tell me which app/command you want to add here.*

 
** Cheatsheet file structure
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   | App or command | keybind or parameter | Description |   
   #+END_SRC

	- The first line is for prompt, just copy this line
	- The other lines should be contents
	- Note: 
	The cheatsheet file also support this format:
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   | App or command | keybind or parameter | Description | Note |   
   #+END_SRC

   The fourth column is "Note" that you could add something important or some personal considerations which only shows in the detail page.

* Preview & Usage
** All cheatsheets mode
   Show all apps/commands cheatsheets in one page. command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   ~/.cheeet/cheatsheet.sh all
   #+END_SRC

   Preview:
   [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangzme/cheeet/master/mode_all.png]]
   
** Single app mode
   
	The first page shows all apps/commands, then enter an specific app cheatsheet.

	Both in All cheatsheets mdoe and single app mode you can enter the detail page.

	command:

	#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	~/.cheeet/cheatsheet.sh sgl
	#+END_SRC

	Preview:
	[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangzme/cheeet/master/mode_sgl.png]]

** With i3
   If you are using i3-wm, just add this line into you i3-wm config:
 #+BEGIN_SRC 
     bindsym $mod+x exec "~/.cheeet/cheatsheet.sh all" # all cheatsheets mode
 #+END_SRC

** Add /Note/ column
   For example, command =convert -> -append= in the orginal cheatsheet file (lib/convert) like:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   | convert | -append                            | append an image sequence | 
   #+END_SRC

   Then the detail page is:

   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   Command: convert
   Parameter: -append
   Description: append an image sequense
   #+END_SRC

   As we know =+append= is appending images horizontally and =-append= is appending images vertically.
   So you can append it after the third column.

   The detail page after editing.
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   Command: convert
   Parameter: -append
   Description: append an image sequense
   Note: +append is appending images horizontally and -append is appending images vertically.
   #+END_SRC
