| dtrx    | -o, --overwrite         | Normally, dtrx will avoid extracting into a directory that already exists, and instead try to find an alternative name to use.

| dtrx    | -n, --noninteractive    | dtrx will normally ask the user how to handle certain corner cases, such as how to handle an archive that only contains one file.  This option suppresses those questions; dtrx will instead use sane, conservative defaults.                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
