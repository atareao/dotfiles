Todas las pulsaciones en la entrada se separan por dos puntos «:». Tenga en cuenta que «pulsaciones» significa realmente eso, por lo que debe escribir lo que realmente quiere pulsar en el teclado. En la tabla de abajo, la columna de la izquierda muestra la entrada y la de la derecha qué escribir.\n\n«intro» (nueva línea)                   Intro o Return\na (a minúscula)                           A\nA (a  mayúscula)                          Mayúsculas+A\n: (dos puntos)                            Mayúsculas+;\n« » (espacio)                           Espacio

Comment=Lea antes el comentario de la acción «Teclee «Hola»».\n\nQt Designer usa Ctrl+F4 para cerrar ventanas. Ctrl+F4 en KDE sirve para ir al escritorio virtual 4, así que no funciona en Qt Designer. Además, este último no usa el estándar de KDE Ctrl+W para cerrar la ventana.\n\nEste problema puede solucionarse asignando Ctrl+W a Ctrl+F4 cuando la ventana activa sea de Qt Designer. Cuando Qt Designer esté activo, cada vez que se pulse Ctrl+W, se le enviará Ctrl+F4. En otras aplicaciones, Ctrl+W seguirá funcionando como siempre.\n\nAhora necesitamos especificar tres cosas: Un nuevo atajo para «Ctrl+W», una nueva acción de entrada de teclado que envíe Ctrl+F4 y una nueva condición que detecte que la ventana activa es la de Qt Designer.\nParece que Qt Designer siempre tiene el título «Qt Designer by Trolltech», así que la condición comprobará si la ventana activa tiene ese título.

Comment=Konqueror en KDE3.1 tiene pestañas y ahora también puede tener gestos. No necesita usar otro navegador>;)-\n\nSimplemente pulse el botón central del ratón y dibuje uno de los gestos, cuando termine suelte el botón central. Si solo necesita pegar la selección, también funciona, simplemente pulse solamente el botón central. (Puede cambiar el botón del ratón a usar en la configuración global).\n\nAhora hay estos gestos disponibles:\nmover a la derecha y luego a la izquierda - Hacia delante (Alt+Derecha)\nmover a la izquierda y luego a la derecha (Alt+Izquierda)\nmover arriba y después abajo (Alt+Arriba)\ncírculo en sentido antihorario - Volver a cargar (F5)\n(Tan pronto como descubra los que se usan en Opera o Mozilla los añadiremos para asegurarnos de que son iguales. Si quiere hacerlo usted, por favor ayúdeme y envíeme su khotkeyrc).\n\nLa forma de los gestos (algunos de los diálogos de KGesture, gracias a Mike Pilone) pueden simplemente introducirse haciéndolos en el diálogo de configuración. Puede mirar al teclado numérico para ayudarse, los gestos se reconocen como una matriz de 3x3, con campos numerados del 1 al 9.\n\nDese cuenta que debe hacer el gesto exacto para realizar la acción. Gracias a esto es posible introducir más gestos para la acción. Debería evitar gestos complicados en los que cambie la dirección del ratón moviéndolo más de una vez (ej. haga 45654 o 74123 ya que son sencillos pero el 1236987 pueden ser bastante difíciles).\n\nLa condición para todos los gestos están definidas en este grupo. Todos esos gestos se activan solo si la ventana activa es Konqueror (clase que contenga «konqueror»).
